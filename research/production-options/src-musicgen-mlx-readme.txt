# MusicGen MLX
Text-to-music generation on Apple Silicon, powered by [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx).
A clean MLX port of Meta's [MusicGen](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) for **inference-only** on Mac M1/M2/M3/M4. Describe the music you want in plain English, get a WAV file back.
> **Early release** — This is a working port but still rough around the edges. Contributions welcome!
## What it does
```bash
musicgen-mlx "a chill lo-fi beat with vinyl crackle and soft piano"
```
MusicGen turns text descriptions into music. This port runs entirely on your Mac's GPU through MLX instead of crawling along on CPU through PyTorch.
## Performance
Benchmarked on Apple M4 Max with MLX 0.21:
| Model | Parameters | 8s audio | Speed |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| musicgen-small | 300M | 6.3s | **1.3x** realtime |
| musicgen-stereo-large | 3.3B | ~24s | 0.3x realtime |
MusicGen is an autoregressive model — it generates audio token by token, so it doesn't parallelize as easily as Demucs. The small model is already faster than realtime. The large model is slower but produces significantly better quality.
## Quick start
### 1. Set up a Python environment
MusicGen MLX requires **Python 3.10 or later**. We recommend using a dedicated conda environment to avoid dependency conflicts (especially with PyTorch):
```bash
# Create and activate a conda environment
conda create -n musicgen python=3.11 -y
conda activate musicgen
```
> **No conda?** You can also use `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`. Just make sure `python --version` shows 3.10+.
### 2. Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrade0/musicgen-mlx.git
cd musicgen-mlx
make install
```
This installs all dependencies (MLX, PyTorch CPU, Transformers, etc.) and puts the `musicgen-mlx` command in your PATH.
### 3. Generate music
```bash
musicgen-mlx "a gentle piano melody with soft strings"
```
The first run downloads the model from HuggingFace (~1.2 GB for small). Generated audio opens automatically on macOS.
> If you see a PATH warning during install, add this to your `~/.zshrc`:
> ```bash
> export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
> ```
### Usage
```
$ musicgen-mlx --help
usage: musicgen-mlx [-h] [-m NAME] [-o FILE] [-d SEC] [--no-open]
 [--top-k K] [--temperature T] [--cfg-coef C]
 prompt
Generate music from text descriptions using MusicGen
on Apple Silicon with MLX.
positional arguments:
 prompt text description of the music to generate
model:
 -m, --model NAME HuggingFace model name (default: facebook/musicgen-small)
output:
 -o, --output FILE output WAV path (default: ./musicgen_output.wav)
 -d, --duration SEC duration in seconds (default: 8)
 --no-open don't open the file after generation
sampling:
 --top-k K top-k sampling (default: 250)
 --temperature T sampling temperature (default: 1.0)
 --cfg-coef C classifier-free guidance coefficient (default: 3.0)
```
### Examples
```bash
# Quick generation with the small model
musicgen-mlx "deep house track with a hypnotic bassline"
# 30 seconds with the large stereo model (best quality)
musicgen-mlx "epic orchestral soundtrack" -m facebook/musicgen-stereo-large -d 30
# Jazz with high temperature for more variation
musicgen-mlx "jazz piano trio improvising" --temperature 1.2 --top-k 500
# Save to a specific file
musicgen-mlx "ambient drone with rain sounds" -o ambient.wav -d 20
# Medium model (good quality/speed balance)
musicgen-mlx "funk guitar riff with wah pedal" -m facebook/musicgen-medium
```
### Use from Python
```python
import mlx.core as mx
import numpy as np
import soundfile as sf
from audiocraft_mlx.models.musicgen import MusicGen
# Load model (downloads on first use)
mg = MusicGen.get_pretrained("facebook/musicgen-small")
mg.set_generation_params(duration=8.0, top_k=250, temperature=1.0)
# Generate
audio = mg.generate(["a chill lo-fi beat"], progress=True)
# Save
wav = np.array(audio[0]) # [channels, samples]
sf.write("output.wav", wav.T, mg.sample_rate)
```
## How it works
MusicGen is an autoregressive transformer that generates audio tokens conditioned on text:
```
 Text prompt
 │
 ▼
 ┌─────────────┐
 │ T5 Encoder │ (runs in PyTorch)
 │ (text→embed) │
 └──────┬───────┘
 │ text embeddings
 ▼
 ┌─────────────────┐
 │ Transformer │ (runs in MLX)
 │ Language Model │
 │ (48 layers for │
 │ large model) │
 └──────┬───────────┘
 │ audio tokens
 ▼
 ┌─────────────────┐
 │ EnCodec Decoder │ (runs in MLX)
 │ (tokens→audio) │
 └──────┬───────────┘
 │
 ▼
 WAV audio file
```
1. **T5 text encoder** converts your prompt into embeddings (runs in PyTorch as a bridge)
2. **Transformer LM** generates discrete audio tokens autoregressively, conditioned on the text embeddings, with classifier-free guidance
3. **EnCodec decoder** converts the tokens back into a waveform
The transformer uses RoPE positional embeddings, KV caching, and 4 interleaved codebook streams.
### MLX-specific design choices
- **Layout convention**: Tensors use `[B, C, T]` format externally; transpose at every Conv1d boundary since MLX expects channels-last
- **T5 bridge**: The text encoder runs in PyTorch, output converted to `mx.array` (pragmatic — avoids porting the entire T5 stack)
- **Weight loading**: Downloads original HuggingFace checkpoints, converts Conv weights (transpose axes), splits MultiheadAttention projections, folds weight norm — all automatically
- **Stereo models**: HuggingFace EnCodec runs in PyTorch for stereo, wrapped with MLX↔torch conversion at boundaries
- **No training code**: Inference-only, all batch norm / dropout / weight init stripped out
## Choosing a model
All models are hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/facebook) and download automatically on first use. Use the `-m` flag to switch models.
### Available models
| Model | Parameters | Channels | Download size | Quality | Status |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------------|---------|--------|
| `facebook/musicgen-small` | 300M | mono | ~1.2 GB | Good | Working |
| `facebook/musicgen-medium` | 1.5B | mono | ~3.2 GB | Better | Working |
| `facebook/musicgen-large` | 3.3B | mono | ~6.5 GB | Best | Working |
| `facebook/musicgen-stereo-small` | 300M | stereo | ~1.2 GB | Good | Working |
| `facebook/musicgen-stereo-medium` | 1.5B | stereo | ~3.2 GB | Better | Working |
| `facebook/musicgen-stereo-large` | 3.3B | stereo | ~6.5 GB | Best | Working |
| `facebook/musicgen-melody` | 1.5B | mono | — | — | Not yet (needs ChromaStemConditioner) |
| `facebook/musicgen-style` | 1.5B | mono | — | — | Not yet (needs StyleConditioner) |
### Which model should I use?
- **Just trying it out?** Start with `musicgen-small` (the default). It's fast (faster than realtime on M4 Max) and the quality is surprisingly good.
- **Want better quality?** Use `musicgen-medium` — better musical coherence and richer sound, about 2-3x slower than small.
- **Best possible quality?** Use `musicgen-large` or `musicgen-stereo-large` — the 3.3B model produces the best results but requires more RAM and patience.
- **Need stereo output?** Add `stereo-` to any model name. Stereo models produce left/right channel audio instead of mono.
- **Melody conditioning?** `musicgen-melody` is not yet supported in this port (it requires a ChromaStemConditioner based on Demucs). Contributions welcome!
### Trying different models
```bash
# Default: small model, fast, good quality
musicgen-mlx "funky disco groove with slap bass"
# Medium: better quality, still reasonably fast
musicgen-mlx "funky disco groove with slap bass" -m facebook/musicgen-medium
# Large: best quality, slower
musicgen-mlx "funky disco groove with slap bass" -m facebook/musicgen-large
# Stereo small: spatial audio, same speed as mono small
musicgen-mlx "ambient pad with wide reverb" -m facebook/musicgen-stereo-small
# Stereo large: best quality + stereo, slowest
musicgen-mlx "cinematic orchestral theme" -m facebook/musicgen-stereo-large -d 30
```
Models are cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/` after the first download. You can pre-download a model without generating anything by running a short generation:
```bash
musicgen-mlx "test" -m facebook/musicgen-large -d 1
```
## Known limitations
This is an early release. Things that could be improved:
- **T5 runs in PyTorch** — the text encoder hasn't been ported to MLX yet. This adds startup time and memory overhead.
- **Stereo EnCodec in PyTorch** — stereo models use the HuggingFace EnCodec wrapper which runs in PyTorch.
- **No melody conditioning** — the `musicgen-melody` model requires a ChromaStemConditioner (Demucs-based) which isn't wired up yet.
- **No extended generation** — generating beyond 30s with sliding window isn't implemented yet.
- **No KV cache optimization** — the KV cache works but isn't optimized for memory reuse.
- **Speed** — autoregressive generation is inherently sequential. The small model is faster than realtime, but larger models are slower.
Contributions to address any of these are very welcome!
## Requirements
- **macOS** with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, or M4)
- **Python 3.10+** (3.11 recommended)
- **RAM**: 8 GB minimum for small model, 16 GB+ recommended for large models
- A conda or virtual environment (recommended to avoid dependency conflicts)
### Dependencies
Installed automatically by `make install`:
| Package | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `mlx` >= 0.17 | Apple's ML framework (GPU acceleration) |
| `torch` | T5 text encoder + weight loading (CPU only) |
| `transformers` | HuggingFace model loading |
| `huggingface-hub` | Model downloads |
| `numpy` | Array operations |
| `soundfile` | WAV file I/O |
| `omegaconf` | Model config parsing |
| `tqdm` | Progress bars |
> **Note on PyTorch**: PyTorch is only used for the T5 text encoder, stereo EnCodec, and initial weight loading. It runs on CPU — the heavy lifting (transformer + audio decoding) runs on Apple GPU through MLX. A future version may reduce or remove the PyTorch dependency.
