## Start Here

The setup wizard installs the Ableton Remote Script, creates the Python environment,
copies the Max for Live Analyzer, and checks the connection:

```bash
npx livepilot --setup
```

Using Claude Desktop? Download the latest `livepilot-<version>.mcpb` from
[Releases](https://github.com/dreamrec/LivePilot/releases/latest) and double-click it.

See [Install](#install) for client-specific setup and manual options.

## What's New in v1.30.0

LivePilot now spends far less context describing itself and gives clearer answers about
what it actually knows.

- **A focused first contact.** Normal sessions advertise 28 useful entry points instead of
  sending all 474 schemas up front. The rest remain searchable and directly callable.
- **Options that mean something.** Decorative Composer, Atlas, and routing parameters are gone;
  sample roles and material filters now change the result; unsupported abstract events fail
  with concrete guidance instead of disappearing silently.
- **Evidence with a label.** Mix and evaluation reports separate measured audio, setup-derived
  heuristics, and artistic judgment. “Less bright” and other reduction goals now score in the
  right direction.
- **Depth when it earns its keep.** Quick creative requests take a quick path. Three-way
  exploration, broad memory reads, and full critic passes are reserved for real ambiguity.
- **More resilient sessions.** Startup no longer waits on optional services, ambiguous network
  failures do not replay destructive edits, and project memory follows the Live set rather than
  ordinary edits inside it.

Previous release v1.29.0 introduced learned perceptual taste, honest confidence gates,
optional CLAP distance, and named Arrangement locators.

Full details in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## What LivePilot Does

LivePilot works at two levels: exact control when you know what you want, and informed
help when you do not.

| Job | What LivePilot brings |
|-----|-----------------------|
| **Work directly in Live** | Control transport, tracks, clips, notes, devices, routing, mixing, automation, and Arrangement View through explicit tools. |
| **Find the right sound** | Search Ableton's library, your own plugins and racks, local samples, and Splice before loading anything. |
| **Listen before judging** | Read live spectral data or analyze rendered audio, then compare the result with the state before the edit. |
| **Explore safely** | Preview alternatives, keep the winner, and route changes inside the set through Ableton's undo stack. |
| **Learn your taste** | Remember which moves, devices, and versions you keep across sessions without treating taste as a universal score. |
| **Stay aware of the song** | Track identity, open creative threads, section roles, and protected elements so local fixes do not flatten the whole piece. |

Under the hood: a 5,264-device atlas, 683 mapped drum kits, 29 sample-processing
techniques, 44 semantic moves, real-time and offline listening, and 12 planning and
evaluation systems. The sections below show how each part works.

## Two Ways to Talk to LivePilot

Start with the language that fits the moment. Both routes reach the same tool surface.

### Route A — Artist / aesthetic shorthand

> *"Sound like J Dilla."* &nbsp; *"Make this feel more like Burial."* &nbsp; *"BoC-style pads."*

Use a producer or genre as shorthand for rhythm, density, space, texture, and device
choices. LivePilot translates the reference into techniques rather than pretending to clone
someone's identity.

### Route B — Direct musical intent

> *"Push the snare 4 ms early, keep the kick on-grid, add ±2 ms timing variation to the hats,
> and cut 3 dB around 380 Hz on the snare."*

When the detail matters, name it: notes, milliseconds, dB, frequency, modulation depth,
envelope shape, send level, automation curve, scale degree, or voice leading.

### Mixing the routes

Most sessions use both. Start broad, listen, then get specific where the track needs it.

### How the pieces connect

**Remote Script** (`remote_script/LivePilot/`) — A Python ControlSurface that runs inside Ableton's process. Listens on TCP 9878. All Live Object Model calls execute on Ableton's main thread via `schedule_message`. Detects Ableton version at startup and enables four capability tiers: Core (12.0+), Enhanced Arrangement (12.1.10+), Full Intelligence (12.3+), Collaborative (12.4+).

**MCP Server** (`mcp_server/`) — Python FastMCP server. Validates inputs, routes commands to the Remote Script over TCP, manages the M4L bridge, and runs the atlas, sample engine, composer, planning, and evaluation systems. This is what your AI client connects to.

**M4L Bridge** (`m4l_device/`) — Optional Max for Live Audio Effect on the master track. Provides deep LOM access through Max's LiveAPI that the ControlSurface API can't reach. UDP 9880 (M4L to server) carries spectral data and LiveAPI responses. OSC 9881 (server to M4L) sends commands. The 38 spectral/analyzer tools strictly require the bridge; device and sample tools that call the bridge also have graceful fallbacks, so core functionality works without it. Backed by 32 bridge commands for hidden parameters, Simpler internals, warp markers, display values, and Simpler warp / Compressor sidechain writes that live on child objects Python can't reach.

**Device Atlas** (`mcp_server/atlas/`) — In-memory indexed JSON database. 5264 devices with browser URIs (bundled baseline), 120 enriched with YAML sonic profiles (mood, genre, texture, recommended chains). 7 indexes: by_id, by_name, by_uri, by_category, by_tag, by_genre, by_pack. Reverse-index `device_techniques_index.json` powers `atlas_techniques_for_device` (146 cross-references across 58 devices). Device and preset choices resolve against the atlas before loading, which reduces guessed names and dead ends. **v1.22.0+**: run `scan_full_library` after install to index your packs, User Library, and plugins into `~/.livepilot/atlas/device_atlas.json` — your personal atlas overrides the baseline and survives npm updates.

**Sample Engine** (`mcp_server/sample_engine/`) — Searches three sources simultaneously: BrowserSource (Ableton's library), SpliceSource (local Splice catalog via SQLite), FilesystemSource (user directories). Every result passes through a 6-critic fitness battery (key, tempo, spectral, genre, mood, technical). 29 processing techniques (Surgeon precision vs. Alchemist experimentation). Builds complete sample processing plans with warp, slice, and effect recommendations.

**Splice Client** (`mcp_server/splice_client/`) — Searches Splice's catalog through two layers: the local SQLite database (`sounds.db`, already-downloaded samples) and the live gRPC API (full catalog, including samples you haven't downloaded yet). The gRPC client auto-detects Splice's dynamic port via `port.conf`, handles self-signed TLS, and enforces a 5-credit safety floor before any download. Per-call timeouts (5–10s) prevent a hung Splice process from stalling the MCP event loop. Graceful fallback to SQL-only if grpcio isn't installed. No API key needed — authentication comes from the running Splice desktop app.

**Composer** (`mcp_server/composer/`) — Prompt-to-plan pipeline. Parses natural language ("dark minimal techno 128bpm with industrial textures") into a CompositionIntent (genre, mood, tempo, key). Plans layers using role templates (kick, bass, percussion, texture, lead, pad, fx). Compiles to a step-by-step plan of tool calls that the agent executes. Does not execute autonomously — returns the plan. 4 genre defaults (house, techno, trap, ambient) — genres outside this set fall back to a neutral layer plan.

**Corpus** (`mcp_server/corpus/`) — Parsed device-knowledge markdown converted to queryable Python structures: EmotionalRecipe, GenreChain, PhysicalModelRecipe, AutomationGesture. Feeds Wonder Mode, Sound Design critics, and the Composer with structured production references at runtime.

**Execution Router** (`mcp_server/runtime/execution_router.py`) — Classifies each step in a multi-step plan as remote_command (TCP to Ableton), bridge_command (OSC to M4L), or mcp_tool (internal), then dispatches it through the correct channel.

## How LivePilot Makes Decisions

Tools make the edit. These 12 systems help decide what to try, what to protect, what to
compare, and what to remember.

### SongBrain — What the Song Is

Builds a real-time model of the session: identity core (what defines this track), sacred elements (what must not be casually damaged), section purposes (what each part is doing emotionally), energy arc (where the song is heading). Detects identity drift when edits pull the track away from what made it work.

### Taste Graph — What You Like

Learns your production preferences across sessions. Tracks which move families you keep vs. undo, which devices you gravitate toward, how experimental you want suggestions (novelty band), and which dimensions you avoid. Every accept/reject updates the graph. Two producers using the same tools get different recommendations.

### Semantic Moves — Musical Actions, Not Parameters

**44 high-level intents** across 7 families (mix, arrangement, transition, sound_design, performance, device_creation, sample) — "add contrast," "tighten the low end," "make kick and bass lock," "sample vocal ghost," "destroy then rebuild." Each move compiles into a concrete tool sequence with risk level, target dimensions, and protection thresholds. Analyzer-gated moves (`tighten_low_end`, `make_kick_bass_lock`) mark their spectrum pre-reads as optional so the plan continues even when the analyzer isn't available. The plan shows its tradeoffs before anything changes.

### Wonder Mode — Stuck-Rescue Workflow

When a session is stuck — repeated undos, overpolished loops, no structural progress — Wonder Mode activates:

1. **Diagnose** — classify the stuckness (loop trap? missing contrast? identity unclear?)
2. **Generate** — find semantic moves that address the diagnosis, enforcing real distinctness
3. **Preview** — apply each variant, capture, undo. Hear before committing
4. **Commit or Reject** — choice recorded into taste and session continuity

### Creative Engines

| Engine | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mix Engine** | Critic-driven analysis: masking, headroom, stereo, dynamics. Plans corrective moves with before/after evaluation |
| **Sound Design Engine** | Analyzes patches for static timbre, missing modulation, weak transients. Suggests parameter moves |
| **Transition Engine** | Classifies transition types (drop, build, breakdown). Scores quality, plans improvements from archetypes |
| **Composition Engine** | Section analysis, motif detection, emotional arcs. Plans structural moves |
| **Performance Engine** | Safety-constrained suggestions for live sets. Knows which moves risk audio dropouts |
| **Reference Engine** | Distills principles from reference tracks. Maps them to your session as concrete moves |

### Hook Hunter

Identifies the most salient musical idea — ranks candidates by recurrence across scenes, motif salience, and section placement (payoff-section boost). Tracks whether hooks are developed, neglected, or undermined, and flags when a transition fails to deliver expected payoff. Rhythm-side ranking is currently heuristic (drum-track detection + clip reuse); true onset-based rhythmic features are on the roadmap.

### Session Continuity

Maintains creative threads ("the chorus needs more lift") and turn resolutions across the session. When you return to a project: *"Last time, you kept the filter sweep for the bridge. The chorus lift thread is still open."*

### Evaluation Loop

Every engine follows: **measure before → act → measure after → compare**. If a change made things worse (more masking, lost headroom, identity drift), the system flags it before you move on.

<br>

## Tools

LivePilot has 474 tools across 57 domains, but it no longer sends that entire
schema to the AI on every connection. The default `producer` profile exposes a
focused 26-tool production loop plus `search_tools` and `call_tool`; every other
tool remains searchable and directly callable by name. This keeps the initial
catalog under 40 KB while preserving the full system.

Use `LIVEPILOT_TOOL_PROFILE=composition`, `mixing`, or `sampling` to pin more
domain tools. Set `LIVEPILOT_TOOL_PROFILE=full` for legacy clients or catalog
diagnostics. Highlights below — [full catalog here](docs/manual/tool-catalog.md).

<br>

### Core Ableton Control — highlights

| Domain | # | What it covers |
|--------|:-:|----------------|
| Transport | 12 | playback, tempo, time sig, loop, metronome, undo/redo, cue points, diagnostics |
| Tracks | 17 | create MIDI/audio/return, delete, duplicate, arm, mute, solo, color, freeze, flatten |
| Clips | 11 | create, delete, duplicate, fire, stop, loop, launch mode, warp mode, quantize |
| Notes | 8 | add/get/remove/modify MIDI notes, transpose, duplicate, per-note probability |
| Devices | 19 | load by name or URI, insert native (12.3+), get/set parameters, batch edit, racks, chains, drum chain note assignment, presets, plugin deep control |
| Scenes | 12 | create, delete, duplicate, fire, name, color, tempo, scene matrix |
| Browser | 4 | search library, browse tree, load items, filter by category |
| Mixing | 11 | volume, pan, sends, routing, meters, return tracks, master, full mix snapshot |
| Arrangement | 21 | timeline clips, native arrangement clips (12.1.10+), arrangement notes, automation, recording, cue points |
| Automation | 8 | 16 curve types, 15 recipes (filter sweep, sidechain pump, dub throw...), spectral suggestions |
| Theory | 7 | Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection, Roman numeral analysis, species counterpoint, SATB harmonization |
| Harmony | 4 | neo-Riemannian PRL transforms, Tonnetz navigation, voice leading paths, chromatic mediants |
| Generative | 5 | Euclidean rhythm (Bjorklund), tintinnabuli (Arvo Part), phase shift (Steve Reich), additive process (Philip Glass) |
| Memory | 8 | save, recall, replay, manage production techniques by mood/genre/texture |
| MIDI I/O | 4 | export/import .mid, offline analysis, piano roll extraction |
| Perception | 4 | offline loudness (integrated LUFS, LRA), spectral analysis, reference comparison |

<br>

### M4L Bridge — 38 analyzer tools `[optional]`, 32 bridge commands

The M4L Analyzer sits on the master track. UDP 9880 carries spectral data to the server. OSC 9881 sends commands back. The `ensure_analyzer_on_master` pre-flight (v1.20.3) loads the analyzer idempotently when an audio-dependent decision needs it.

> [!TIP]
> Most tools work without the analyzer — it adds 38 spectral/analyzer tools (frequency, loudness, perception, Simpler, warp) and closes the feedback loop.

```
SPECTRAL ─────── 9-band frequency decomposition (sub_low → air)
                 sub_low (20-60 Hz) split off so kick fundamentals don't hide inside sub
                 true RMS / peak metering
                 Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection

DEEP LOM ─────── hidden parameters beyond ControlSurface API
                 automation state per parameter
                 recursive device tree (6 levels into nested racks)
                 human-readable display values as shown in Live's UI

SIMPLER ──────── replace / load samples
                 get slice points, crop, reverse
                 warp to N beats, get audio file paths

WARP ─────────── get / add / move / remove markers
                 tempo manipulation at the sample level
```

<br>

### Device Atlas — 13 tools

The atlas is an in-memory indexed database of Ableton's entire device library.

```
5264 devices total
  120 enriched with sonic intelligence (mood, genre, texture, chains)
   47 with aesthetic-tagged signature_techniques
  683 drum kits mapped with note assignments

```

**v1.23.0 — User-local extensions:** Drop YAML files at `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/<namespace>/` to extend the atlas with custom hardware libraries, signature chains, or technique recipes — survives npm updates. See [`docs/EXTENSION_API.md`](docs/EXTENSION_API.md).

**v1.23.4 — Pack-Atlas Phases C/D/E/F:** Six new corpus-driven orchestration tools turn the 3,917 parsed pack sidecars + 104 demo `.als` parses into actionable artifacts — find similar presets, transplant aesthetics across BPM/scale/genre, narrate a demo, extract a track's chain as a runnable plan, bootstrap pack-coherent compositions, run any of 15 cross-pack workflow recipes. All execution is dry-run by default — returns plans, doesn't auto-mutate the session.

### User Corpus — 14 tools `[v1.23.4+]`

> **Why this exists.** The factory atlas covers what Ableton ships. Most studios also have
> third-party plugins, Max for Live devices, custom racks, presets, and sample packs. The corpus
> builder indexes that local library so recommendations can use tools you actually own.

The corpus builder turns what is installed on your machine into searchable production context:

```
Phase 1 — DETECT      Walk plugin folders + run `auval -a` for AUv3 / Mac Catalyst
                       coverage. Captures format (VST3/AU/AAX/CLAP/LV2),
                       vendor, version, bundle ID. ~40-200 plugins typical.

Phase 2 — CANONICALIZE Dedupe by vendor+name, prefer VST3 over AU, strip vendor
                       suffix variants ("Valhalla DSP, LLC" = "Valhalladsp" =
                       "Valhalla DSP"). Cluster by vendor for batch research.

Phase 3 — RESEARCH    Discover local manual files (PDFs, READMEs) per plugin.
                       Prepare focused plugin and technique research tasks.

Phase 4 — SYNTHESIZE  Build a per-plugin identity.yaml
                       with sonic_fingerprint / reach_for / avoid / key_techniques /
                       parameter_glossary / comparable_plugins / genre_affinity /
                       producer_anchors. Keep one primary format tag (no
                       dual-indexing across formats).
```

The result lives at `~/.livepilot/atlas-overlays/user/plugins/<plugin_id>/identity.yaml` and is available to `atlas_search`, `atlas_chain_suggest`, `atlas_macro_fingerprint`, and `atlas_describe_chain` alongside the factory atlas. Every result names its source (`factory_atlas` or `user_overlay:user`), so you can see whether a recommendation comes from Ableton stock or your own gear.

```
corpus_setup_wizard            One-shot orchestration — runs the full pipeline
corpus_init                    Initialize ~/.livepilot/corpus/ + manifest.yaml
corpus_status                  Inspect manifest, sources, scan history
corpus_list_scanners           Enumerate registered scanner types
corpus_add_source              Register a new scan source (project / racks / Max / samples)
corpus_remove_source           Remove a scan source from manifest
corpus_scan                    Run scanners on configured sources
corpus_detect_plugins          Phase 1 — VST3 / AU / AUv3 / VST2 / AAX / LV2 detection
corpus_canonicalize_plugins    Phase 2 — dedupe + VST3-preferred + suffix strip
corpus_cluster_plugins         Phase 2.5 — group by vendor for efficient research dispatch
corpus_trim_plugin_identity    Slim a yaml to the overlay-required minimum
corpus_discover_manuals        Phase 3 — locate local PDFs / READMEs per plugin
corpus_research_targets        Phase 3 — prepare research tasks for the agent
corpus_emit_synthesis_briefs   Phase 4 — prepare identity briefs per plugin
```

**Why this matters.** A static index goes stale when your library changes. Re-scan after adding
a plugin or rack and LivePilot can consider it alongside Ableton's factory devices.

**Quick start:**

```bash
# In your MCP client (Claude Code / Desktop / Cursor):
corpus_setup_wizard                              # one-shot orchestration
# OR fine-grained control:
corpus_detect_plugins use_auval=true             # finds AUv3 / Mac Catalyst plugins
corpus_canonicalize_plugins                      # VST3 preference + vendor dedup
corpus_cluster_plugins                           # vendor-grouped clusters
corpus_research_targets                          # → agent researches the plugins
corpus_emit_synthesis_briefs                     # → agent writes identity profiles
```

### Sample Engine — 23 tools

Search Ableton, local folders, and Splice together, then rank results against the musical
role instead of returning a pile of filenames.

```
SOURCES ─────────── BrowserSource  (Ableton's built-in library)
                    SpliceSource   (local Splice catalog via SQLite)
                    FilesystemSource (user-specified directories)
                    Splice LIVE    (gRPC + GraphQL for the full catalog)

CRITICS ─────────── key fitness · tempo fitness · spectral match
                    genre alignment · mood alignment · technical quality

TECHNIQUES ─────── 29 processing recipes:
                    Surgeon (precise, transparent) vs.
                    Alchemist (experimental, transformative)

PLAN-AWARE ─────── Ableton Live plan   100 samples/day (no credit drain)
                    Sounds+/Creator     CREDIT_HARD_FLOOR=5 safety gate
                    Free samples        bypass both gates
```

### Splice Integration

LivePilot reads Splice's local SQLite database to search your downloaded samples with full metadata. No API key needed — it reads the database file directly.

**What it does:**
- Searches your downloaded Splice samples with key, BPM, genre, and tag metadata
- Integrates as a third source alongside Ableton's browser and filesystem scanning
- Works without a Splice subscription — any previously downloaded samples are searchable

**How it works:** The Sample Engine's `SpliceSource` reads `~/Library/Application Support/com.splice.Splice/users/default/*/sounds.db` — Splice's local SQLite catalog of downloaded samples. Read-only, no network calls.

**Requirements:** Splice desktop app running (the MCP server talks to it over gRPC at a dynamic port advertised via `port.conf`, with self-signed TLS). For fully offline search, previously-downloaded samples are always searchable via the local SQLite fallback even if the Splice app isn't running.

### Composer — three modes (v1.25.0)

Prompt-to-plan composition workflow. Three modes share the same safety checks: reconnect the
bridge, load the analyzer when needed, set monitoring correctly on new tracks, and return to
Arrangement View after the build. The work stays visible as a sequence of tool calls.

```
"dark minimal techno 128bpm with industrial textures and ghostly vocals"
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Prompt Parser   │ → CompositionIntent (genre, mood, tempo, key)
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Layer Planner   │ → role templates (kick, bass, perc, texture, lead, pad, fx)
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Plan Compiler   │ → executable tool sequences
└────────┬────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Execution Router │ → dispatches: create tracks, search samples, load devices,
│                  │   program notes, set volumes, build arrangement
└─────────────────┘
```

#### fast mode — `compose_fast_apply`

Quick loop sketch. Single scene in session view. Intended for roughing out ideas quickly.

- Hunt order: curated `.adg` chains from the browser first, atlas devices second, bare instruments only as last resort
- Drum-role pitch repair included (Simpler default root vs. MIDI 36 offset)
- 4 genre defaults: house, techno, trap, ambient (unknown genres fall back to a neutral layer plan)
- Invoke with: *"Make me a [genre] loop at [tempo] BPM"*

#### full mode — `compose_full_apply`

Full track with song form: intro, verse, hook, breakdown, outro. Uses a two-phase LLM-creative brief flow — the LLM authors the form (sections, track list, per-section variants); the framework supplies the vocabulary (device hunt order, MIDI generation rules, arrangement conventions).

- Per-section MIDI variants prevent repeated tiles across the arrangement
- Native arrangement clips via `create_native_arrangement_clip` (one clip per section, looped to fill section length)
- Zombie-track cleanup in postflight (removes tracks with no clips and no instrument device)
- Drum-role pitch repair ported from fast mode
- **Atlas anchors:** role-level device knowledge is supplied through `KnowledgePack.atlas_anchors`, which consults the indexed atlas rather than filename matching. The older `atlas_candidates_per_role` field is a deprecated legacy stub, kept empty for back-compat.
- Invoke with: *"Write a full [genre] track at [tempo] BPM"* or *"Build a full arrangement"*

#### develop mode — `develop_apply`

Extends an existing 8-bar loop without disturbing the seed material.

- Introspects the existing session (classifies tracks by name and content)
- Pulls artist and stylistic references from the user prompt
- Writes per-track variants and new supporting layers alongside the seed
- Invoke with: *"Develop this loop"* or *"Extend what's here into a longer idea"*

#### KnowledgePack scaffolding (v1.25.0)

All three modes share a `KnowledgePack` that provides structured creative context at runtime:

- `event_lexicon` — 42 structural events across 7 categories (drum density, harmonic, texture, vocal, rhythm feel, tension, fx gesture)
- `genre_context` — parses the 15-genre `genre-vocabularies.md` at load time
- `artist_context` — parses the ~25-producer `artist-vocabularies.md` at load time
- `atlas_anchors` — indexed-atlas device anchors per role (replaced the legacy `atlas_candidates_per_role` stub)

#### Core composer tools

- `compose` — plan a multi-layer composition from text prompt (entry point, mode-agnostic)
- `compose_fast_apply` — execute fast mode directly
- `compose_full_apply` — execute full mode directly
- `develop_apply` — execute develop mode directly
- `augment_with_samples` — plan sample-based layers for an existing session
- `get_composition_plan` — dry-run preview (see the plan without credit checks)

## Install

### Claude Desktop: one-click install

Download the latest `livepilot-<version>.mcpb` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dreamrec/LivePilot/releases/latest) and double-click it.
Claude Desktop installs everything automatically. Then:

1. Open Ableton Live 12
2. Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI → Control Surface → **LivePilot**
3. Start chatting

> [!TIP]
> The Desktop Extension auto-installs the Remote Script and M4L Analyzer on first launch.

### Terminal: one-command setup

```bash
npx livepilot --setup
```

Runs the full setup wizard: checks Python, installs the Remote Script, creates the Python environment, copies the M4L Analyzer, and tests the Ableton connection.

### Manual: Step by Step

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Remote Script</strong></summary>

```bash
npx livepilot --install
```

Restart Ableton → Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI → Control Surface → **LivePilot**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. MCP Client</strong></summary>

**Claude Code** — pick one (installing both registers the MCP server twice and collides on port 9878):
```bash
# MCP server only:
claude mcp add LivePilot -- npx livepilot

# Or the full plugin (MCP server + skills + slash commands):
claude plugin marketplace add github:dreamrec/LivePilot
claude plugin install livepilot@dreamrec-LivePilot
```

**Codex App:**
```bash
npx livepilot --install-codex-plugin
```

**Claude Desktop (macOS)** — `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "LivePilot": { "command": "npx", "args": ["livepilot"] }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop (Windows):**
```cmd
npm install -g livepilot
livepilot --install
```
`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "LivePilot": { "command": "livepilot" }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "LivePilot": { "command": "npx", "args": ["livepilot"] }
  }
}
```

**VS Code** — `.vscode/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "LivePilot": { "command": "npx", "args": ["livepilot"] }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. M4L Analyzer (optional — adds 38 tools)</strong></summary>

Drag `LivePilot_Analyzer.amxd` onto the master track for real-time spectral analysis.
The `--setup` wizard and Desktop Extension install both the device and its sibling bridge script automatically. From v1.20.3, your AI client can also call `ensure_analyzer_on_master` — an idempotent pre-flight that loads the device if missing and no-ops otherwise. Creative workflows call it only when the decision or verification needs audio evidence.

> **Important:** The Analyzer must be the LAST device on the master track — after all effects (EQ, Compressor, Utility) so it reads the final output signal. The pre-flight tool reports `is_last_on_master: bool` and warns if the invariant is broken.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Splice (optional — adds sample catalog)</strong></summary>

If you have Splice installed with downloaded samples, the Sample Engine can search them with full metadata (key, BPM, genre, tags) via the local SQLite database.

No API key, no configuration — the Sample Engine reads Splice's `sounds.db` file directly.

Without Splice, the Sample Engine still searches Ableton's browser and your filesystem.

</details>

## Plugin

**Codex App**

```bash
npx livepilot --install-codex-plugin
```

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add github:dreamrec/LivePilot
claude plugin install livepilot@dreamrec-LivePilot
```
